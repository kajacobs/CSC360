# Dining Philosophers
## Katherine Jacobs V00783178    

For this assignment, I initially read through the wikipedia page on the dining philosopher problem. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem

I initially tried my hand at this problem only using the information given on the wikipedia page, but I was unsuccessful. I found the two solutions below from Geeksforgeeks and the university of Massachusetts that were very similar, and followed these solutions to complete this assignment.

These are the additional resources I used to understand the assignment better.
