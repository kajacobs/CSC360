# Data Parallelism 
## Katherine Jacobs V00783178

For this assignment I created 2 .c files. I started originally with datasingle.c, which is the single threaded version of this assignment. I felt it would be easier to start there, and then change it to be multithreaded. This also allowed me to use both files when analyzing the difference between multi and single threaded. 

I have created a shell script to run my tests, which is included as test.sh. Additionally I created separate .csv files, one for the small data set given in the assignment spec, and another for just the year 2002 from the 10 year data set so I could compare my slopes/absolute residuals with the information given.
